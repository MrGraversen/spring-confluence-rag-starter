# ðŸ§  spring-confluence-rag-starter

**Your documentation has the answers â€” finally. Spring Boot + RAG-powered answers**

# What is this?

A Spring Boot starter module that connects to your **Confluence workspace**, ingests pages into a **vector database**, and uses **OpenAI + LangChain4j** to answer questions about your docs.

Itâ€™s dead simple:

1. Configure your Confluence access
2. Run ingestion
3. Query your own internal knowledge using natural language

Designed to help developers, teams, and tools get real answers â€” without digging through a decade of stale pages and broken links.  Point it at your space, ingest the pages, and start asking questions.

# ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… Works out-of-the-box with Spring Boot 3.5+
âœ… Uses OpenAI embeddings for vectorizing your knowledge
âœ… Applies OpenAI ChatGPT to answer your questions  
âœ… Auto-ingests Confluence pages via the REST API  
âœ… Stores docs as vectors in **Postgres** (Using `pgvector` extension)  
âœ… **LangChain4j** under the hood   
âœ… Built as a clean, reusable Spring Boot starter - Just add the dependency and you are getting started!

# ðŸ§ª Example: Talking to "Helios Core"

For demo purposes, this project uses a fictional internal Confluence space called **Helios Core**, a space-opera-flavored company wiki used to test RAG under realistic document structures.

**Hereâ€™s a real page ingested into the vector store:**
